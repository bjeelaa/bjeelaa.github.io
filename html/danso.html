        <h1>let's talk danso</h1>
        <h3>i'll be explaining what danso is</h3>
        <br>
        <p>ok so...<br>
        danso (=ikemen joshi) is a form of j-pop that is based around girls dressing up as boys <i>(slogan THE HOOPERS: "Eight girls dressed up as beautiful boys").</i><br>
        the group to "invent" danso in 2007 years ago was Nakano Fujo Sisters, who became fudanjuku when they metamorphosed into their male personas. fudanjuku still exists<br>
        THE HOOPERS (my favorite group) was formed as the "little brother group" of fudanjuku in 2014. THE HOOPERS held their last concert at the start of 2019 ðŸ˜­<br>
        some more groups popped up, and in 2019 dreamBoat came into existence. dreamBoat is synonymous with danso, and currently manages fudanjuku, Pipping Hot and BOP.</p>
